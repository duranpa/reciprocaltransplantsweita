In Supplementary Figure 1:
1) We first calculate the dissimilarity between microbial communities in control samples (without treatments before the actual experiment and 8 weeks after inoculation)(Bray-Curtis dissimilarities) and we calculate the coordinates for each sample to plot them (seen in SuppFig1c)
2) Then, we calculate shannon indexes (alpha diversity, how many different microbial species are found within a sample) and add the values to the design file and plot them in a boxplot (see in SuppFig1b)
3) We also calculate significant distances by performing a Kruskal Wallis test with a Dunn's post hoc test (p<0.05), separately per microbial group (Italian and Swedish)
